========================
Vagrant Python-dev Setup
========================

These are the instruction for creating a simple Python development environment using a virtual machine.  The virtual machine will reside within your pc.  
Please note that the virtual machine  uses the Ubuntu operating system.  You will note that the system uses a command line interface rather than a GUI.  
This interface is typical of Python development environments.  If you wish to add a GUI you can look into using the GNU Gnome  GUI.  Once you have completed the 
installation you will be able to invoke Python from the command prompt by entering the word "python".

I will continue to enhance this installation with additional pyhon development tools.
  

The instructions assume you are working in MS Windows on your PC.  If you are using a diffent os your instructions may vary

Installing
==========


1. Install Vagrant: http://vagrantup.com

2. Install Virtualbox: http://wwww.freewareupdate.com DO NOT INSTALL THE LATEST VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE.  Install version 4.1.22 
(latest version os not compatible wih the Vagrant softwareas of the writing 20-Sep-2012).

3. Install the Virtual machine (in vagrant parlance this is called the "box")::

       $ vagrant box add lucid32 http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box

4. Clone the Github repository and run!::

       $ git clone git://github.com/udacians/PythonDevEnvironment.git ossdev
       $ cd ossdev
       $ vagrant up

Using
=====

1. Once its all setup, you can get the IP address and port of your VM via::

    $ vagrant ssh
2. Now invoke PuTTY to access your VM.  When PuTTY asks for the ip address and port use the information that you got from the prior
step. PuTTY can be downloaded from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

If at any point the VM needs to be restarted simply invoke 
      $ vagrant up
